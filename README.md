# Amelioration: *The act of making something better.*

I will work on a coding project for at least an hour a day (excluding Sundays) to track and visualize my progress, to get better at programming, and, most importantly, **to have fun**.

## DAY 1: Ruler

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">[image]</td>
    <td><strong>Today's Progress:</strong> I was able to ... CSS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I felt ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Link(s):</strong> ...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## DAY 2: Clock

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">[image]</td>
    <td><strong>Today's Progress:</strong> I was able to ... CSS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I felt ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Link(s):</strong> ...</td>
  </tr>
</table>
