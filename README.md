# Amelioration: _The act of making something better._

I will work on a coding project for at least an hour a day (excluding Sundays) to track and visualize my progress, to get better at programming, and, most importantly, **to have fun**.

## DAY 1: Butterfly

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3"><img src="/images/butterfly.png" alt="CSS Butterfly" /></td>
    <td><strong>Today's Progress:</strong> I was able to learn how to use transparent borders to create polygons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I felt that it was a bit difficult to position each shape in the box and I hope to get more adept at it as I keep practicing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Link:</strong> None</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## DAY 2: Clock

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3"><img src="/images/clock.png" alt="CSS Clock" /></td>
    <td><strong>Today's Progress:</strong> I was able to ... CSS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I felt ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Link:</strong> None</td>
  </tr>
</table>
